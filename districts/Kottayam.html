Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek 1 km to reach the summit of the peak.
                              Illikkal Mala comprises three hills, each rising up to 3,400 ft above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock)

Here lies the beautiful valley of Ilaveezhapoonchira, one amongst the many prime picnicking spots in the area. The beautiful hillocks near Kanjar are known to have great trails for trekking. The view in itself is breath-taking. During the Monsoons, the entire place transforms into a surreal spectacle. The terrain changes and one observes Nature at her best. It is highly recommended to view both sunrise and sunset from the valley as the picturesque landscape opens up in a unique and exhilarating way at those specific times.

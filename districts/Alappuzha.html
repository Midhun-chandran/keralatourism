The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.</div>

                          <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Pathiramanal, which means “Sands of the Night”, is a small lake island located on the backwaters of Alappuzha in Lake Vembanad. It is a bird watcher’s paradise since it is supposed to hold approximately 91 local species of birds and 50 species of migratory birds. The location of the island is extremely scenic, making it a lovely space to observe birds and the water.

It is also completely uninhabited so you don’t have to worry about the crowd and hawkers disrupting the beauty. However, because it is uninhabited and not a major tourist hotspot, you will find that it lacks the usual facilities that bring tourists to comfort like benches in order to sit, restrooms, and places to buy food from. Let this not be a distraction since the island is very small and can be toured within an hour, which means that you won’t necessarily be inconvenienced by the lack of facilities, especially if you go prepared.<ul class="postcard__tagbox">
